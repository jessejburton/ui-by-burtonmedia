# UI by BURTON**MEDIA**
A minimal class CSS framework for a simple blog style website.

Includes styling for:

* Layout
  - Header
  - Footer
  - Sidebar
  - Navigation (with sub-navigation)
* Design
  - Theming
* Typography
* Forms
  - Inputs
  - Buttons
* Data
  - Loaders
  - Tables
* Cards

You can view a demo of this framework [here](https://burtonmediainc.com/ui/). The demo includes examples of dark and  high contrast themes as well as a layout switcher. The selected theme and layout are then stored in the browsers localStorage.

## Usage
Using this framework is simple!

You can either clone this repository and edit the html as needed.

This will clone the repo into the current folder, replace . with a folder name to clone into a new folder.

    git clone https://github.com/jessejburton/ui-by-burtonmedia.git .

The unparsed SASS files are in the src/styles folder, you can edit them there and re-parse to .css using the method of your choice. Personally I use VSCODE with the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) extension by [Ritwick Dey](https://ritwickdey.github.io/#!/).

or

Simply download and include the [style.min.css](https://burtonmediainc.com/ui/css/style.min.css) file in your project and use the index.html file from this repo as a guide.
